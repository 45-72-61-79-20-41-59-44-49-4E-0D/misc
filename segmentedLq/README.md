Segmented Least Squares
====

An improved version of least squares method, in which the data set can be fitted by several line segments, instead of 1 single line as in Least Squares.

Contents:
------

* `segmentedLsq.py`: implementation of the Segmented Least Squares algorithm
* `test.py`: some simple (stupid) test cases of the algorithm
* `segmentSpec.py`: an application of Segmented Least Squares in segmentation of spectrogram images.

Usage:
------

* For `segmentedLsq`, check `test.py` for some sample code.
* For `segmentSpec`:

    $ python segmentSpec.py data/SI648.png
